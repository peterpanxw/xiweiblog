## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This approach is "*variational*" because we optimize for the best `$q_{\pmb{\phi}}(\pmb{z}|\pmb{x})$` amongst a family of potential posterior distributions parameterized by `$\pmb{\phi}$`; it is called "*autoencoder*" due to its resemblance to a traditional autoencoder model, where input data is trained to predict itself after undergoing an intermediate bottlenecking representation step.
