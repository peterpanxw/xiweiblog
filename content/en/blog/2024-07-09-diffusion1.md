## Preface
Diffusion models have recently gained widespread attention due to improved sampling quality and more stable training protocols. Notable examples include [DALLÂ·E 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06125), which generates high-quality images from text prompts, and [Sora](https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/), which focuses on video generation. In mechanics community, [Nikolaos N. Vlassis, WaiChing Sun](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045782523002505) and [Jan-Hendrik Bastek, Dennis M. Kochmann](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00762-x) have successfully applied these (video) denoising diffusion models to the inverse design of microstructures/metamaterials with nonlinear properties. Inspired by their work, I aim to explore these areas further, starting with diffusion models.

This is a collection of notes documenting my learning process on diffusion models. In the first few posts, I mainly focused on understanding key terminologies and the underlying mathematical and statistical principles. And I'll continue to update with code implementations when I have time. The main reference I'm using is the detailed and accessible paper [*Understanding Diffusion Models: A Unified Perspective*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11970) written by [Calvin Luo](https://www.calvinyluo.com/about.html).
