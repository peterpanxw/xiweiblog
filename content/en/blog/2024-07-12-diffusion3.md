## Variational Diffusion Models (VDMs = MHVAE + 3 Restrictions)

<font color=Red>A VDM can be viewed as a *Markovian Hierarchical VAE* plus three key restrictions:</font>
> - The latent dimension is exactly equal to the data dimension
> - The structure of the latent encoder at each timestep is not learned; it is pre-defined as a linear Gaussian model. In other words, it is **a Gaussian distribution centered around the output of the previous timestep**
> - The Gaussian parameters of the latent encoders vary over time in such a way that the distribution of the latent at final timestep `$T$` is a **standard Gaussian**

The Markov property between hierarchical transitions from a standard MHVAE is explicitly maintained. We then present related explanations of the above assumptions.
