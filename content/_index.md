Hello, welcome to my homepage! My name is **Xiwei (Peter) Pan**, a native of the beautiful city of [Yangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou), China. I'm currently a master's student at [Dalian University of Technology (DUT)](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/) working with Prof. [Yichao Zhu](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/zhuyc/zh_CN/index/968943/list/index.htm). I am very interested in multiscale modeling of complex systems, with a focus on spatially varying multiscale configurations and plate/shell structures.

Before starting my master's program, I also earned a bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics (Qian Lingxi Excellence in Education Program) from DUT. There, I gained a strong foundation in fundamental yet crucial courses in mathematics, mechanics, and computer science.
